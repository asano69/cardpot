// Package wikilink keeps the "card_links" collection in sync with the
// [wiki links] found in each card's text, so 1-hop and 2-hop link views
// can be answered from the database instead of re-parsing every card.
//
// A link row stores its target only as text (target_title and
// target_titleLc, mirroring the "cards" fields of the same names). The
// target card may not exist yet, may be renamed, or may be created later,
// so a link never needs to know whether its target exists. Its identity is
// target_titleLc -- the same case-insensitive key "cards" itself uses to
// enforce title uniqueness (see internal/serve/slug.go's
// resolveUniqueTitleInPot) -- and a target is matched to a card only at
// query time, by (pot, titleLc).
