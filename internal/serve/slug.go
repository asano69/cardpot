// Package serve: slug.go resolves a unique display "title" for a card
// from arbitrary candidate text (the card's header, or its first body
// line if the header is empty). This is deliberately separate from
// ydoc.go's Yjs persistence hook: title resolution is called for a new
// card (see createCardHandler in cards.go) and by the debounced header
// watcher (see title_watch.go), not on every Yjs update.
//
// A card's URL segment is no longer a separate stored field -- it's
// derived from this same title on demand (see internal/slug.FromTitle
// and its frontend mirror, frontend/src/lib/slugify.ts), since the
// (pot, title) unique index already guarantees a title never collides
// within a pot.
