// title_watch.go resolves a card's title purely from server-side
// observation of its live Yjs "content" text, debounced per room. This

// (see frontend/src/components/noteEditor/ExistingCardEditor.tsx) had to
// itself notice a header edit and round-trip an HTTP request to resolve
// it. Resolving here instead means the title can never desync from what
// the room's document actually holds, and it now updates regardless of
// which peer -- or how many peers -- are editing the room.
