// per pot, not once per page. Before this existed, CardList and
// CardForm each called useTopBarPotLink themselves; navigating between
// them unmounted one page's registration (clearing the link) before
// the other page's mounted its own, flickering TopBar's pot-name link
// and "add card" button on every transition. Nesting both pages under
// this layout keeps the registration mounted continuously across that
// transition instead.
//
// The pot itself is also fetched exactly once here and shared via
// PotContext, instead of each nested page fetching it again on its
// own -- CardList and CardForm used to each run their own
// fetchPotBySlug, and navigating between them while the first request
// was still in flight made PocketBase's SDK auto-cancel it as a
// duplicate, breaking navigation.

  // open, so a card opened directly by URL finds an up-to-date replica too.
  // Link results (see lib/stores/linkAliveStore.ts) are only computed once
