          "name" field, not its PocketBase id (see CardList.tsx
          and CardForm.tsx, which resolve the actual record via
          this name). PotLayout owns fetching the pot and registering
          TopBar's pot-name link (see PotLayout.tsx), so it stays
          mounted continuously while navigating between CardList and
          CardForm below instead of flickering on every transition. */}

        <Route path="/" component={CardList} />
        {/* "/new" (draft creation) and "/:cardSlug" (edit) share ONE
            Route -- not two separate <Route> elements -- so navigating
            between them never remounts CardForm/NoteEditor.
            CardForm's own URL-sync effect replaces "/new" with
            "/:cardSlug" the instant a draft's title resolves (right
            after createCard() returns); with two separate pages,
            Solid Router treated that as a match against a different
            Route and tore down the still-connecting WebsocketProvider
            and its in-memory Y.Doc before the just-typed header ever
            reached the server. The freshly mounted NoteEditor then
            synced against the (still empty) server room, so line0
            came back blank -- intermittently, only when the WebSocket
            handshake lost the race against that reactive navigate.
            "new" is a reserved slug (see internal/serve/slug.go's
            reservedSlug handling), so a real card can never resolve to
            it and collide with this literal path; it's listed first
            so the static segment still wins the match. */}
