// knowing which specific syntax it belongs to. A mark node that
// should stay visible even when the cursor isn't touching it (e.g.
// CodeBlockMark's `code:` declaration) simply omits this prop.

// while the cursor isn't touching it, rather than just its delimiter
// marks. Image/LinkedImage nodes have no open/close mark children at
// all (see rules/bracket.ts) -- their raw "[url]" text is only useful
// while actively editing it, since the actual image is already shown
// separately as a widget (see imageWidget.ts). Nodes tagged with this
// prop have their whole range replaced with nothing instead of only
// hiding mark children (see syntaxReveal.ts).

// range. A NodeProp cannot vary per individual tree node (it belongs to a
// NodeType), so this prop identifies those children while `to - from` provides
// the character-count depth.
