// - The new line starts with a verbatim copy of the current line's own

//   the same order), so the list continues at the same depth without
//   normalizing the indentation to tabs. Only the indentation left of
//   the cursor is copied: whitespace to its right travels down with
//   the rest of the text, so pressing Enter in the middle of the
//   indentation never doubles it.
// - A bulleted line with nothing typed yet (just its indentation) is
//   "released" instead: its indentation is stripped in place and a
//   plain newline follows, exiting bullet mode rather than nesting an
//   empty bullet under another empty bullet.
// - Inside a `code:` block the same copy applies, but nothing is ever
//   released: a code line holding only whitespace is still part of
//   the block, and flattening it would end the block. The new line
//   therefore always stays deeper than the `code:` declaration.
